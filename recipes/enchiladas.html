    <p class="recipe-description">
        Today's dish of choice is spicy red enchiladas!
        I've had many different kinds of enchiladas in this world, but the ones I've always found the most delicious
        were right at home, cooked by ma.
        Beef or cheese, it's delicious either way because the real secret is in the sauce, and with my ma's sauce, you
        can never go wrong.
        I hope you enjoy this recipe to your heart's content as I do every month!

            <ol class="directions-list">
                <li>Roast dried peppers on cast iron skillet for a few minutes until fragrant, don't scorch or you'll
                    have a
                    bitter sauce</li>
                <li>Cut open peppers and deseed, gloves are best practice. Then place in a bowl and cover with boiling
                    water
                    for 20-30 minutes until soft</li>
                <li>Roast tomatoes, tomatillos, 4 cloves of garlic and 3/4 of the onion until browned, then add water to
                    cover halfway and raise to a boil for 2 minutes. Stir to evenly blanch each side of the vegetables
                </li>
                <li>Transfer pepper and vegetable mixtures into a blender, add cilantro and a tsp of salt, then grind
                    until
                    smooth</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan, add oil to lightly cover the bottom, heat to medium-low, and pour the blender
                    mixture inside. cook for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350F</li>

                </li>
                <li>Put ground beef off to the side, get one more pan, and put about 1/2 to 1 cup of oil to flash fry
                    tortillas in at medium-high</li>
                <li>Once the sauce is done and the oil is hot enough (check with a drop of water, if it pops it's
                    ready),
                    place a baking tray to the side of the sauce, where you'll immediately transfer the tortillas after
                    flash frying them and covering with sauce. Get a pair of tongs, grab a tortilla, flash fry in the
                    oil
                    for 5-10 seconds on each side, then drag both sides of the tortilla across the sauce until covered.
                    Transfer to the baking tray where you'll stuff the tortilla with ground beef and tightly roll.
                    Repeat
                    for every tortilla until the tray is filled</li>
