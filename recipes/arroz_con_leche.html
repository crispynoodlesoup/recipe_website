    <p class="recipe-description">
        Today's dish brings me way back to my childhood.
        I specifically remember that the second recipe I ever learned was arroz con leche, or rice pudding for you
        non-spanish speakers.
        I've made this single dish more times than I would care to count because it's never takes anymore than 30
        minutes to make, or even a run to the store for special ingredients.
        At this point, it's my tradition to make arroz con leche whenever I don't have cereal, and i hope it can become
        yours too!
