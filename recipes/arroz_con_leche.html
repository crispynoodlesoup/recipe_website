        <p>
            Today's dish brings me way back to my childhood. 
            I specifically remember that the second recipe I ever learned was arroz con leche, or rice pudding for you non-spanish speakers. 
            I've made this single dish more times than I would care to count because it's never takes anymore than 30 minutes to make, or even a run to the store for special ingredients. 
            At this point, it's my tradition to make arroz con leche whenever I don't have cereal, and i hope it can become yours too!
