        <p>
            Today's dish was my introduction to baking. 
            One of the first delectable desserts that I made was brownies, which I sold to my middle school classmates to make an extra buck.
            Ever since then, I knew that this recipe deserved a gold star for simplicity and quality.
            If I could make it good enough to sell like gold as a greedy 10 year old, then you can too!
