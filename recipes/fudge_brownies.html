    <p class="recipe-description">
        Today's dish was my introduction to baking.
        One of the first delectable desserts that I made was brownies, which I sold to my middle school classmates to
        make an extra buck.
        Ever since then, I knew that this recipe deserved a gold star for simplicity and quality.
        If I could make it good enough to sell like gold as a greedy 10 year old, then you can too!
